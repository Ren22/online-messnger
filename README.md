## Information

This is an online chat, part of the Yandex Practicum Middle Frontend course, Module 1.
It is built in plain JS + Typescript without any frameworks.

The architecture of the project is separated according to MVC.
Model part is responsible for communication with backend API and can be found in `services` directory.
View and Controllers are stored together per each component in the `components` and `pages` directories.
The core `Block.ts` implements EventBus and dynamically re-renderes once the properties of the Block are updated. The Block is a central functional part and is inhereted by all components/pages. 
The rendering is done with the help of `handlebars`.

All forms have a validation with regular expressions. The events are triggered on blur/focus of an input field.

A separate class to have HTTP requests based on XMLHttpRequest is introduced.

The Routing over `pages` uses History API.

The project has a a Dockerfile to create an image. Currently it's deployed on [heroku](https://fast-hamlet-74665.herokuapp.com/).

Cookies are used to store a user session.

The project is tested with Mocha + Chai + Sinon + jsbin. Currently only the router is tested.

## Chat functionality

A user can login or register on the login/registation page. 
After that a user is redirected to the messenger page where he can create/delete a chat.
User can also click on the profile link to edit personal information or logout from the app.
